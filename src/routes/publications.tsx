              The Jordan Rift Valley (JRV) is a depression produced by the
              active Dead Sea Transform (DST), separating the Sinai subplate and
              the Arabian Plate. Its beginning is related to the late Miocene
              (~6 Ma), when sinistral displacement of the DST gained an
              extensional component, thus accentuating the subsidence of the
              JRV. This shift is recorded by Messinian basalt flows that cover
              JRV eastern slopes (Zerqa Ma, Mujib, and Tafila basalts; 6–3.4 Ma)
              and the Cover basalt (5.8–3.6 Ma) in the Galilee region. Sediments
              from the Sedom Lagoon since ~12 Ma suggests that the JRV was
              already a shallow depression connected with the Mediterranean Sea,
              which at the early Pliocene (5–4 Ma) lost permanently this
              connection due to the uplift of the JRV flanks. More information
              about geomorphology and drainage pattern of the region during the
              Late Miocene is limited to information available along the western
              side of the JRV, including the fluvial/lacustrine Hazeva Fm
              (~20–6.4 Ma) in the Arava region and lacustrine/marine formations
              in the lower Galilee (~17–5 Ma). Here we discuss the implications
              of Zarqa Valley geomorphological features and its
              volcano-sedimentary infill to the Miocene evolution of the JRV.
              The Zarqa Valley is carved into Cretaceous/Paleogene bedrocks at
              the Eastern Flank of the JRV, and it hosts a perennial water
              drainage system flowing westward to the Jordan River. The oldest
              dated filling of the Zarqa Valley is represented by a series of
              late Miocene lava flows, named collectively as “Lower Basalt”
              (LB), spanning 5.82 to 5.51 Ma. It records the existence of a
              pre-existing valley in the late Miocene, with already at least 300
              m of incision, observed by the difference of the base of the LB
              and the bedrock summits surrounding the valley. The LB outcrops
              ca. 40 km east of JRV axis and its thickness increases eastward to
              more than 100 m. W-NW paleocurrent data in conglomerates
              underlying the LB indicate that the Zarqa River maintained the
              same flow towards the JRV since the Late Miocene. The occurrence
              of the LB in the Zarqa Valley is synchronous with the dramatic sea
              level fall of Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC, 5.97–5.33 Ma), when
              the Sedom Lagoon lost temporarily the connection to the
              Mediterranean Sea. Opposite to what is observed throughout the
              Mediterranean Sea, where rivers underwent a profound incision
              phase, the Zarqa Valley experienced aggradation of conglomerates
              and thick basalt flows. We propose that this is an indication that
              Sedom Lagoon acted as local base level of an endorheic drainage by
              the time when the MSC started, possibly with an increasing water
              table, necessary to produce the accumulation space to account for
              the Zarqa Valley deposition. We hypothesize that a highstand of
              the base level in the JRV during the MSC can be explained by a
              favorable climate and several stream capture in the Levant that
              caused rivers to migrate to the endorheic drainage of the Sedom
              Lagoon.

              The fluvial Dawqara Formation, upper Zarqa Valley, eastern side of
              Jordan Valley, is chronologically constrained between 2.52 and
              1.98 Ma. Several artifact-bearing outcrops display a core and
              flake industry, with no handaxes nor planned flaking. Herein, we
              describe 40 artifacts from section 334 Lower, the earliest
              archeological site of the formation and one of the oldest Oldowan
              complexes outside Africa. Despite the occurrence of basalt rocks,
              all artifacts were made on chert cobbles displaying various
              degrees of abrasion due to fluvial transport. The industry is
              represented by 30 flakes and 10 cores and choppers, preferentially
              obtained on chert cobbles with massive-fan form, unifacially and
              bifacially flaked. Most of the flakes present plain or cortical
              platforms and show on their dorsal faces a unipolar production
              scheme. Eighteen flakes, from unipolar or undetermined cores,
              exhibit a discontinuous retouch, defining a denticulated or convex
              margin. The assemblage is compared to Oldowan or lower Acheulean
              complexes in and outside Africa, pointing to a rapid spread of
              unknown hominins with this flaking technology, possibly ascribable
              to an early Homo clade.
